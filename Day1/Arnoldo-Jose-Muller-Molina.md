# Hacking the Human Genome Using Clojure and Similarity Search
* stuff about stem cells
* how DNA transcription works... Transcription factors
* searching for unknown transcription factors
* first find a dictionary of DNA words
* then group into possible transcription factors

## benefits of clojure
* simplicity of arbitrary format data consumption
* expressiveness of lisp for data problems plus all the existing tools in the jvm. 
* cluster->refine->filter->sort->merge method has general applicability.
