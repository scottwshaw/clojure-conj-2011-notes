# something, something, oesterhout's dichotomy
* How do you classify powerfullness or expressiveness of a programming
  language
* There's no single dimension that allows you to classify programming
  languages in terms of power
* Poetry: is free verse more powerful than sonnet?
* Music: is trombone more powerful than a piano?
* In some cases, power might be bad 
  * goto, global variables, mutability, are powerful, but harmful
* "feeling power comes from comgining and constraining expressive
  power
* Osterhout wanted people ot use tcl instead of C
  * 
* Interesting claim: Clojure adds values, identity, polymorphism to
  Lisp expressive powers
* One set of things to measure abstraction powers: concision,
  locality, simplicity -- Paul Graham has something to say about these
* foreign function interfaces allow you to dodge bullets
  * an acceptable way to code where 90% is done in scripting language
    then you drop down to the DB or something for the 10% system-level
    stuff
* Stuart claims Clojure requires no bullet dodging
  * you get both simple scripting and access to Java platform power
* Writing Clojure in Clojure "proves" you have platform power
* Differences between Clojure and ClojureScript illustrate platform
  power of Clojure
* There are a few simplicity exceptions.  For example, if you want to
  create an interface of your Clojure code for consumption in Java,
  you still need to type out an interface.  That's desireable (in
  Stuart's opinion)
* What's missing
  * better error messages -- this seems to be an inside joke that has
    come up many times
  * Stuff that would make it easier for beginners
* You can add these things without changing the core and making a
  change that will go through Rich
  * With 1.3 the tools are all there to create your own ease of
    development environment "modular contrib"
