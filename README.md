Notes I took during Clojure/conj 2011, in Raleigh, NC, November
10,11,12.  Some are more complete than others, but the act of taking
notes helps me retain information and I thought others might benefit.

Note: these notes are all in markdown format so you are probably best
advised to just browse the repo here rather than cloning and reading
it locally.
