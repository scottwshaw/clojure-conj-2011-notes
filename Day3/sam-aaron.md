# Notes on the Synthesis of Music (Overtone)
* based on "notes on the synthesis of form" by Christopher Alexander
* Really great intro describing the contrast between current state of
  computer music and what happens with analog instruments and groups.
  The computer musicians inject very little communication and
  improvisation into the process.
  * How do you express virtuosity with computer music or even
    notation?  State of the art is way to complex for the audience to
    be able to connect.
  * Notation does allow non-virtuosos to participate in the art also
    allows expressing complex forms for communication
* Supercollider is the sound generation code that allows you to
  combine generators and processors, etc.
* Overtone provides live interaction with supercollider through the
  repl
* open sound control - like midi but over tcp or udp
* More, more, more... too fun to watch to be bothered with taking
  notes.  Sorry, watch the video.
