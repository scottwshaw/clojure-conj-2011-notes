# Neal's Master Plan for Enterpise Mindshare Domination
* has slept with Stuart Halloway, apparently
* Ways to reduce mu, the coefficient of friction

## how do things become popular in the enterprise
* exaplanation of the radar
* Doing your own
  * one for devs, one for the CTO
* how do you overcome the CTO notion that you must be able to hire
  tons of inexpensive developers?
  * (really means "I'm afraid")
* Many decisions are made knowing things will fail but they'll have a
  defensible position when it does
  
### \#mollify
  * create new clojure-ists everywhere
  * create a Why's guide in Clojure
  * lurk around schools
  * koan contests
  * The actual fear is not of Lisp, it is of "different"
	* make Clojure commonplace
* Neal's tech history
* Moved from clipper to Delphi instead of other borland stuff
  which then went to Rails
  * People who get shit done (pirates)
  
### \#hoist (the pirate flag)
* RESTful integration?
* O/R mapping?
* rules engines (wide open space?)
* breaking and entering (Linux, Rails)

### \#camoflage
* cat burglary (as in Ruby via Cucumber, Groovy via Gradle)
* make clojure.jar as common as antlr.jar helps with \#mollify

## How do you make something popular
* be like Fox News

### \#propagandize
* stay on message
* pimp the knitted castle
  (http://www.amazon.com/Knit-Enchanted-Castle-Jan-MESSENT/dp/085532600X)
* *stay positive* (like Charles Nutter)

## Build a bridge to popularity
* We're bringing a gun to knife fight

### \#packheat
* prove it!
* know your enemies

### \#befriend
* "Scala fetishizes complexity just like Java used to"
  * therefore will be the next big thing :-)
  * but we shouldn't emphasize this--instead make friends

### \#encapsulate (the entire world)
* come to them, don't make them come to you
